                    and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                    such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                    but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                    through daily experiences

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The most common division is between formal, non-formal, and informal
                    education.[c] Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, typically with a
                    chronological and hierarchical order. The modern schooling system organizes classes based on the
                    student's age and progress, ranging from primary school to university. Formal education is usually
                    overseen and regulated by the government and often mandated up to a certain age.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Types of education are often categorized into different levels or
                stages. One influential framework is the International Standard Classification of Education, maintained
                by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This classification
                encompasses both formal and non-formal education and distinguishes levels based on factors such as the
                student's age, the duration of learning, and the complexity of the content covered. Additional criteria
                include entry requirements, teacher qualifications, and the intended outcome of successful completion.
                The levels are grouped into early childhood education (level 0), primary education (level 1), secondary
                education (levels 2–3), post-secondary non-tertiary education (level 4), and tertiary education (levels
                5–8).
